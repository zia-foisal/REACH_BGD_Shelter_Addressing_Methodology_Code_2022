# REACH_BGD_Shelter_Addressing_Methodology_2022

This repository contains the methodology and script used to generate the sequential shelter addressing in the Rohingya Refugee Camps of Cox's Bazar District, Bangladesh.

REACH BGD, in collaboration with UNHCR Bangladesh, is implementing the project in the UNHCR-managed camps. The detailed methodology is shared with IOM-NPM colleagues to follow the same methodology in the IOM-managed camp sites. The project started in August 2021 where the initial guided methodology and codes were written by [**Dr. Ben Smith, Data Specialist for REACH BGD**](https://github.com/DrBenSmith). Later on, the detailed methodology and code were slightly adapted to incorporate the learning from fieldwork and stakeholder consultations.

The project overview slides can be accessed using the following link to Shelter/NFI sector meeting slides 13 to 35: [Shelter NFI Sector meeting of 21 July 2022 Slides](https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/sites/www.humanitarianresponse.info/files/documents/files/20220721_shelter_nfi_sector_meeting_slides.pdf)

### The R programming codes, maps, and database are not published due to issues related to the protection of the refugees. For more information, please contact the REACH and UNHCR Information Unit.
